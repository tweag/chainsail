# Sampling a 2D Gaussian mixture with a single chain and RESAAS
This use case demonstrates how sampling a mixture of four two-dimensional Gaussian distributions is difficult with a single Markov chain. 
See the [general use case instructions](../README.md) for informations on how to test RESAAS on this use case.
